# Tickets booking Application
# Develop a Ticket Booking Application featuring user login and registration with verification mechanisms. Implement a home page displaying a minimum of 5 shows or movies, each with its details page. Create a booking seats page allowing users to select their desired seats for the chosen show. Utilize a use case for booking: when a user selects seats, proceeds to checkout, and receives a receipt, those seats must be blocked for other users. Integrate Razorpay payment portal for secure checkout, enabling users to complete transactions seamlessly. Ensure a user-friendly, responsive UX design for seamless browsing and booking across devices. Ensure that the checkout process includes confirmation of booking and generation of receipts, with records of receipts being saved for future reference.
